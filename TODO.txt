TODO before release
===================

* Dox for all projects

* Clean up the p5.core Utilities class!

* Investigate the p5.threading, and find out why [fork] is not the root node, when using a [wait] invocation. Which MIGHT be the corrrect way to
  do things, but make sure!!

* Investigate why a "shared reference node" won't have its reference node updated for multiple [fork] inside of a single [wait]

* Simplify p5.mail and p5.mime

* Finish dox for p5.mime, p5.strings, and all other projects

* Consider moving "PGP key" Active Events into p5.crypto ...?

* Create some sort of "persistent login" (remember me functionality)

* Consider documenting all Active Events by adding a [_dox] node, allowing consumers to invoke them with [add] trickery to retrieve dox.

* Replace Hyperlambda parser, with option to preserve comments as [#comment] nodes, such that we can parse files, without loosing comments,
  and create automated refactoring features, etc. Also make it more stable. It's not 100% today ...

* Create sample folder in System42, with some example lambda pages, showing of some feature for users.

* Make support for children widgets in tree view widget.

* Create [lambda2xml] and [p5.csv.lambda2csv] events.

* Unit tests for XML/HTML and CSV files.

* Clean up all of the above conversion projects.

* Create [delete-from-row-id] for Datagrid widget.

* Make sure [join] works without arguments, to simply concatenate strings.

* Icon support for Navbar through _class on items. Also add support for other types of widgets, such as textbox search, buttons, etc...

* Make sure all widgets that are crawlable use the same "get URL" logic, if we can ...

* Make sure datagrid can be set into "read only" mode, without neither [.on-edit-item] nor [.on-select-items]

* Change the [src] and [dest] argument names to [p5.string.replace] to something more intuitive.

* Change the [chars] argument in [p5.string.trim] to something more intuitive.

* Refactor p5.web, especially the widgets part. Try to support expressions during creation among other things.

* Fix editing of unit tests, when a test is clicked, it throws due to parameters being passed in the wrong way.

* Figure out why modal windows in e.g. CMS is not given focus to any controls initially.

* Check out if we should allow widget Ajax events to take expressions during creation.

* Consider creating [p5.web.widgets.ajax-events.delete] and [p5.web.widgets.lambda-events.delete]

* Rethink widget lambda events logic, since it is impossible to have multiple handlers for the same Active Event return values.

* Investigate why we're escaping property name in p5.web/WidgetProperties.CreatePropertyReturn method.

* Create logo, a yeallow pentagram star, with a ring around it.

* Making sure we're using the correct JS inclusions all over the place, alternatives are [p5.web.send-javascript] and [p5.web.include-javascript]

* Make sure deletion of attribute and/or widget in p5.ajax, removes all other relevant changes in "_changes" such that we don't send redundant data back.

* Investigate creating support for "p5.reflection", allowing us to instantiate CLR objects, and invoke methods and properties for them.

* [create-widgets] (plural form) that takes a [widgets] collection, and creates these widgets according to a [parent], [position], [before], [after] argument
