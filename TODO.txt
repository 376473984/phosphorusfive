TODO before release
===================

* Clean up the p5.core Utilities class!

* Investigate the p5.threading, and find out why [fork] is not the root node, when using a [wait] invocation. Which MIGHT be the corrrect way to
  do things, but make sure!!

* Investigate why a "shared reference node" won't have its reference node updated for multiple [fork] inside of a single [wait]

* Consider moving "PGP key" Active Events into p5.crypto ...?

* Replace Hyperlambda parser, with option to preserve comments as [#comment] nodes, such that we can parse files, without loosing comments,
  and create automated refactoring features, etc. Also make it more stable. It's not 100% today ...

* Create sample folder in System42, with some example lambda pages, showing of some feature for users.

* Create [lambda2xml] and [p5.csv.lambda2csv] events.

* Unit tests for XML/HTML and CSV files.

* Clean up all of the above conversion projects.

* Make sure [join] works without arguments, to simply concatenate strings.

* Rethink widget lambda events logic, since it is impossible to have multiple handlers for the same Active Event return values.

* Investigate why we're escaping property name in p5.web/WidgetProperties.CreatePropertyReturn method.

* Make sure deletion of attribute and/or widget in p5.ajax, removes all other relevant changes in "_changes" such that we don't send redundant data back.

* Investigate creating support for "p5.reflection", allowing us to instantiate CLR objects, and invoke methods and properties for them.

* [create-widgets] (plural form) that takes a [widgets] collection, and creates these widgets according to a [parent], [position], [before], [after] argument

* Verify execute-lamba-file correctly handles lambda injection (no execution)

* Why aren't arguments to evaluation of lambda files passed into the order they're supplied ...?

* [save-file] cannot handle a "?node.string" [src] expression returning multiple nodes.

* Creates unit test for invoking dynamic Active Event, with expression [_arg], leading to multiple values, making sure
  lambda injection is not possible. This was a severe bug found in XUtil.EvaluateLambda, which I think is fixed, but not entirely certain.

* Make sure we do not pass in attributes back to client that was not actually changed during Ajax request, for cases where an
  an attribute is changed to its already existing value.

* Check formatting strings, since for instance a [p5.types.date.now] invocation inside e.g. {0} seems to be locally formatted.

* Test populating a "select" widget on client side, and see if we can retrieve its value on the server.
  Also make sure that ONLY "empty" select widgets are possible to populate this way, to avoid as much as possible, client being able
  to "inject" logic into server.

* Check up sys42.windows.modal.hl, line 273, I think this is supposed to be "onkeydown" and not "keypressed" ...?

* Possible bug in [switch], breaks [for-each] when [break] is supplied.

* Inclusion of JavaScript and CSS files needs to support the integrity and crossorigin attributes.

* Sephia Five, .onretrieve being raise while in settings throws exception, and locks screen

* Clean up [sys42.cms.download-file] and associated logic.

* Sometimes two widgets have the same ID, which throws an exception. Rethink generating IDs for widgets.

* Investigate using .Net Core, apparently you can include System.Web in such a way, according to an email I got.

* Investigate forcing correct usage of CAPS, even on Windows for files and folders in p5.io.

* Consider moving [p5.string.decode-base64] out from p5.strings, since it's not actually a "string type of event", but rather "blob type of event".

* Verify creating an Ajax event that does not already exists using [p5.web.widgets.ajax-events.set] actually works.
  I suspect it does not work, since there is something fishy with the "common_event_handler" logic.

* Importing private PGP key doesn't seem to work.

* Clean up "identity" in PGP parts, since we're using [email] as argument, which technically is not right, since it's an "identity" rather.
