TODO before release
===================

* Dox for all projects

* Clean up the p5.core Utilities class!

* Fix bugs created during refactoring in "Controls" CMS and "Files"

* Investigate the p5.threading, and find out why [fork] is not the root node, when using a [wait] invocation. Which MIGHT be the corrrect way to
  do things, but make sure!!

* Also investigate why a "shared reference node" won't have its reference node updated for multiple [fork] inside of a single [wait]

* Simplify p5.mail and p5.mime

* Finish dox for p5.mime, p5.strings, and all other projects

* Consider moving "PGP key" Active Events into p5.crypto ...?

* Check if [create-user], [edit-user], etc - Active Events should not check if Ticket is "root" account ...?

* Consider allowing the [zip] Active Event work like [save-file], with a relative source, creating multiple archives in one go.
  Do the same with [unzip]

* Consider [memento] Active Event, that can serialize an execution tree into e.g. Session or something, for then to have it
  recalled and continued evaluated using [recall] or something.
  Allows for temporary "halting" server execution, to fetch data from end-user, before recalling execution, considering the
  data from user, which is a really freaking *SICK* feature!! :D

* Make sure none of the unrelated files are dependent upon CMS in any ways. Among other things, "installation" loads up a template.

* Create some sort of "persistent login" (remember me functionality)

* Make sure p5.data cannot access nodes from root or file nodes (minimum /*/* expressions)

* Make sure the Hyperlisp CodeMirror editor uses the supplied JSON object for autocompletion, also to determine keywords

* Consider documenting all Active Events by adding a [_dox] node, allowing consumers to invoke them with [add] trickery to retrieve dox.
