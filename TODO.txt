TODO before release
===================

* Dox for all projects

* Clean up the p5.core Utilities class!

* Investigate the p5.threading, and find out why [fork] is not the root node, when using a [wait] invocation. Which MIGHT be the corrrect way to
  do things, but make sure!!

* Also investigate why a "shared reference node" won't have its reference node updated for multiple [fork] inside of a single [wait]

* Simplify p5.mail and p5.mime

* Finish dox for p5.mime, p5.strings, and all other projects

* Consider moving "PGP key" Active Events into p5.crypto ...?

* Check if [create-user], [edit-user], etc - Active Events should not check if Ticket is "root" account ...?

* Create some sort of "persistent login" (remember me functionality)

* Make sure p5.data cannot access nodes from root or file nodes (minimum /*/* expressions)

* Make sure the Hyperlambda CodeMirror editor uses the supplied JSON object for autocompletion, also to determine keywords

* Consider documenting all Active Events by adding a [_dox] node, allowing consumers to invoke them with [add] trickery to retrieve dox.

* Replace Hyperlambda parser, with option to preserve comments as [#comment] nodes, such that we can parse files, without loosing comments,
  and create automated refactoring features, etc. Also make it more stable. It's not 100% today ...

*  Make sure all common dialogues optionally takes [_parent] and [_class] arguments

* Create sample folder in System42, with some example lambda pages, showing of some feature for users.

* Make support for children widgets in tree view widget.

* Create [lambda2xml] and [lambda2csv] events.

* Unit tests for XML/HTML and CSV files.

* Clean up all of the above conversion projects.

* Make sure [vocabulary] yields also widget lambda events.

* Fix [sys42.utilities.get-widget]

* Create [delete-from-row-id] for Datagrid widget.

* Complex widgets inside of TabControl doesn't work, due to [oninit] including JavaScript, which fissles, since widget is iinvisible ...
