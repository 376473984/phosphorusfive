TODO before release
===================

* Dox for all projects

* [file-set-read-only] event

* Fix the usage of "no brute attack login" in login logic

* Clean up the p5.core Utilities class!

* Fix bugs created during refactoring in "Controls" CMS and "Files"

* Add link to YouTube channel on main README.md file

* Remove the [get-event] Active Event, and implement some "system42" dynamic event, that does the same, through "event lambda injection code"

* Investigate the p5.threading, and find out why [fork] is not the root node, when using a [wait] invocation. Which MIGHT be the corrrect way to
  do things, but make sure!!

* Also investigate why a "shared reference node" won't have its reference node updated for multiple [fork] inside of a single [wait]

* Investigate if we should prefix all "native" Active Events, such as [p5.mime.create-native], with "_", to avoid calling them from p5.lambda?

* Simplify p5.mail and p5.mime
