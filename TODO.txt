TODO before release
===================

* Dox for all projects

* investigate if the FileInfo.Encrypt/Decrypt metthods should be implemented. More specifically, if they're supported
  in Mono, and if it's any point in implementing them. (uses "current account" for encrypting/decrypting, whatever that means)

* [file-set-read-only] event
