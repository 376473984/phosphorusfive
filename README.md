===============

phosphorus five is a web application framework for mono and asp.net.  phosphorus adds the fun back into creating 
web apps.  phosphorus is;

* secure
* lightweight
* beautiful
* flexible
* intuitive

## secure

the web, and especially javascript, is not considered secure.  phosphorus fixes this by making sure all your 
business logic stays on your server, in addition to tying everything down by default.  with phosphorus, you 
have to explicitly choose to open things up to expose yourself to attacks

*"with phosphorus five, you can sleep at night"*

## lightweight

phosphorus is lightweight in all regards.  the javascript sent to the client is tiny, there is no unnecessary 
html rendered, the http traffic is tiny, and the server is not clogged with expensive functionality

*"with phosphorus five, you can scale"*

## beautiful

phosphorus features beautiful code, and allows you to create beautiful code yourself.  the class hierarchy is 
beautiful and easy to read, and contains no overhead.  the javascript and html rendered is beautiful and 
standard compliant.  phosphorus facilitates for you creating beautiful code that is easy to maintain

*"with phosphorus five, your code is easy to understand"*

## flexible

phosphorus is extendible and flexible.  it allows you to easily create your own logic, overriding what you 
need to override, and not worry about the rest.  with phosphorus you decide what html and javascript is being 
rendered back to the client, down to the very last detail

*"with phosphorus five, you are the captain"*

## intuitive

phosphorus is easy to understand, and contains nothing you do not already know how to use.  it builds on top 
of asp.net, html, javascript and json.  if you know c#, asp.net and have used other libraries such as jQuery 
or prototype.js before, then you don't need to learn anything to get started

*"with phosphorus five, you already know what's needed"*
