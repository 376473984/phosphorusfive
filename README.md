adds the fun back into creating web apps.  phosphorus is;

* secure
* lightweight

## secure

the web, and especially javascript, is insecure by design.  phosphorus fixes this, 
by making sure all your business logic stay on your server.  phosphorus also ties 
everything down by default, and makes your systems safe against intrusions

*"with phosphorus five, you sleep at night"*

### lightweight

phosphorus is lightweight in all regards.  the javascript sent to the client is 
tiny, there is no unnecessary html rendered, the http traffic is tiny, and the 
server is not clogged with expensive functionality.  phosphorus solves the problems 
that needs to be solved and nothing more

*"with phosphorus five, you grow into heaven"*

### beautiful

phosphorus features beautiful code, and allows you to create beautiful code yourself.  
the class hierarchy is easy to understand.  the javascript and html rendered is easy 
to read, and conforms to all known standards.  phosphorus facilitates for you 
creating beautiful end results

*"with phosphorus five, you are beautiful"*

### flexible

phosphorus is highly flexible.  it allows you to easily create your own logic, 
overriding what you need to override, and not worry about the rest.  with phosphorus, 
you decide what html and javascript is being rendered back to the client and how 
your class hierarchy should be designed

*"with phosphorus five, you are the boss"*

### intuitive

phosphorus is easy to understand, and contains few things you do not already know how 
to use.  it builds on top of asp.net, c#, html, javascript and json.  if you know c#, 
asp.net, and have used libraries such as jQuery or prototype.js before, then you 
don't need to learn anything new to get started

*"with phosphorus five, your first hunch is probably right"*

## getting started

after downloading phosphorus five, open up the *"phosphorus.sln"* file in visual 
studio, xamarin or mono develop, and start the project *"phosphorus.ajax.samples"* 
if you wish to run the phosphorus.ajax samples
