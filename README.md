Phosphorus.Five
===============

Phosphorus.Five is a Web Operating System.  Phosphorus' intention, is to add
the fun back into creating apps, and allow you to build software that can 
run unchanged for millenniums. Phosphorus is:

* Secure
* Lightweight
* Beautiful
* Flexible
* Intuitive

#### Secure

The web is insecure by design. Phosphorus changes this by easily allow you to
use PGP encryption and signatures where it makes sense. In addition, Phosphorus
is built such that you'll never leak any Business Logic to JavaScript, as long
as you follow its best practices.

#### Lightweight

Phosphorus is lightweight in all regards. The JavaScript sent to the client is 
tiny, there is no unnecessary html rendered, the HTTP traffic is tiny, and the 
server is not clogged with resource intensive functionality.  Phosphorus allows
you to turn what would normally be a huge project into a tiny project by allowing
you to reuse everything you build.

#### Beautiful

Phosphorus features beautiful code, and allows you to create beautiful code yourself.
The class hierarchy is easy and intuitive to understand. The JavaScript and HTML
rendered is easy to read, and conforms to all known standards. Phosphorus facilitates
for you creating beautiful end results.

#### Flexible

Phosphorus is highly flexible. It allows you to easily create your own logic, 
overriding what you need to override, and not worry about the rest. With Phosphorus, 
you can _orchestrate_ your software together, much the same way a conductor controls
a symphony orchester.

#### Intuitive

Phosphorus is easy to understand, and contains nothing you don't already know how
to use. It builds on top of ASP.NET, C#, HTML, JavaScript, JSON, MIME and PGP. If you 
know C# and ASP.NET from before, then you know everything you need to get started.
