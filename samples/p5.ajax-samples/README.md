p5.ajax examples
========

This folder contains the samples for p5.ajax, in addition to some basic unit tests, for
testing the integrity of p5.ajax.

Contains some examples of how to use p5.ajax as a stand alone library, without anything else,
but the Ajax library itself, directly from C#, as an ASP.NET Web Forms application.

If you want to test this project, make sure you set the "p5.ajax-samples" as your startup project in Visual Studio,
Xamarin or MonoDevelop, and start your debugger.

There are multiple pages, explaining some aspect of p5.ajax each. How to modify a Container widget's children collection
for instance, changing attributes of widgets during Ajax callbacks, using the JavaScript API directly to invoke Ajax "web methods"
through JavaScript, etc.

The code should be fairly self-explaining, and well documented.
