Temporary folder
========

This folder contains all of your temporary files, automatically created by the system.
Notice, this folder will be periodically emptied, so don't rely upon the existence of
files inside of this folder. The folder is purely meant as a temporary folder.

To use this folder in file paths, transparently, you can use the path _"~/temp/"_.
