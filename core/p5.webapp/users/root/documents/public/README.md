Public Folder
========

This folder contains all of your public files. The files in this folder you can create hyperlinks
to, to allow others to download them. If you want to allow others to download a file called "x.zip"
from this folder for instance, you would send them a link pointing to
http://your-server.com/users/your-username/documents/public/x.zip. To reference files in this folder
transparently, you can use the path _"~/documents/public/"_.
