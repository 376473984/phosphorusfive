Modules
========

This folder contains all the installed applications and modules of Phosphorus Five. It is the equivalent of _"Program Files"_ on a windows system.
If you wish to pre-distribute specific modules, and/or apps, this is the folder where you'd like to put these apps. At which point, you could create
your own "distribution", with whatever apps you'd like to have installed.
