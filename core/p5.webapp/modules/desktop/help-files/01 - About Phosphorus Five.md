## About Phosphorus Five

Phosphorus Five is a web operating system, and a web application development framework, with some pretty
unique USPs. Among other things, it's extremely dynamic in nature, allowing for orchestrating your application
building blocks together, almost the same way you would assemble LEGO bricks into creations.
Phosphorus Five is built around three axioms, which you can read three MSDN Magazine articles about at the
following URLs. Notice, these articles are fairly technical in nature, and intended for software developers.

* [Active Events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt795187), providing a functional alternative to OOP, where polymorphism and encapsulation is being performed at the _"function level"_ instead of at the class level
* [Hyperlambda](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt809119), which is a natural consequence of Active Events
* [Managed Ajax](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt826343), providing an automatic bridge between your server side Hyperlambda and your client side JavaScript

The above three USPs provides an extremely flexible application abstraction layer, on top of the .Net Framework/CLR
or C#, allowing you to create web apps much faster than what you'd achieve using conventional techniques.
Phosphorus Five is particularly well suited for _"enterprise types of web apps"_, managing data, using web forms
and similar types of techniques - And probably not that well suited for apps that are intended to be massively
scalable, such as social media platforms, required to respond to millions of web requests every day.

Phosphorus Five contains a whole range of apps, which we refer to as the _"GaiaSoul Suite"_, that allows you
to rapidly create your web apps, one way or another. Some examples of such apps are given below.

* __Hyper IDE__ - A web based Integrated Development Environment
* __Magic Menu__ - A global navigation system, with support for speech recognition and speech synthesis, allowing you to use _"natural language"_ to control your computer
* __Camphora Five__ - A CRUD app generator, allowing you to create CRUD apps, literally in seconds, without requiring you to know any programming

### Philosophy

Phosphorus Five is about privacy, freedom of expression, and the freedom to create - Without having to conform
to the terms of others. Hence our slogan, which goes like this _"In the beginning there was Hyperlambda"_. If you
don't understand where I picked up that slogan, feel free to pick up any Bible. The idea is to allow for a close and
personal relationship to the act of creation, without any intermediaries controlling the terms, and/or your access.
Gutenberg was my philosophical inspiration while developing Phosphorus Five. Gutenberg's idea was to commoditize
access to _"the word"_ (AKA; God) - While my idea is to allow you to use _"the word"_ to communicate with your
computer, and have it do what you want it to do, without a cast of _"gurus"_ acting as intermediaries on your
behalf, or some shady people spying on your data and privacy in the process.

### About the help system

These help files are actually _"alive"_, which means they contain snippets of code, illustrating some concept,
which will be evaluated on the server when you click the _"flash"_ button. This gives you an interactive path
to learn Phosphorus Five, creating a _"hands on"_ approach. Below is an example. Notice, this example
only works in browsers that have speech synthesis. Hint; Google Chrome does ...

```hyperlambda-snippet
/*
 * Using speech synthesis from Micro to utter a sentence.
 *
 * Hint; Click the button in the bottom right corner of
 * this "snippet" to evaluate this piece of Hyperlambda.
 */
micro.speech.speak:Hello, my name is Phosphorus Five
  voice:Karen

/*
 * Displaying an information bubble window.
 */
micro.windows.info:Hello World!
```

You can also copy and paste example snippets, such as the above, into Hypereval - At which point you can modify them,
and play around with them, to include the tactile parts of your brain while learning. If you want to learn
Hyperlambda, I have written a _"book"_ about it, which you can find by clicking the _"home"_ button in the help
files, and choosing the _"Hyperlambda"_ sub section.

### None mentioned, none forgotten

There are extremely strong forces in this universe who do not want to see me succeed with my vision - Which
is to democratize the art of creating web apps, to distribute the World Wide Web, and the powers it holds for
humanity. I invented Managed Ajax in 2006, I wrote a business plan called _"Gaia, Web OS"_ in 2007,
I invented Active Events in 2009, and I created the first implementation of Hyperlambda in 2013 - With the sole
intent of distributing power, and democratize the internet. I have literally spent more than a decade
chasing this idea!

In this process, I have had my name slandered, I have gone to jail on two different continents, I have
been physically deported from Silicon Valley, I have in periods lived as a homeless on the street, and I
have _literally been crucified_ - Because I believe in a democratized world wide web, and commoditizing
the art of creating software. I have fled from country to country, living as a refugee - And my last
experience in Norway, before I fled to Cyprus, where I am living today in exile - Was a failed
assassination attempt at my person and my wife.

If you believe as I do, that Phosphorus Five has value for you, and the world at large - I would seriously
consider purchasing a _"commercial license"_ - Or at the very least support me financially
any ways you can. This system, believe it or not, was in its entirety created by one single human being -
Me that is - And I am _not_ a rich man. In fact, quite the contrary. You can donate money to me below.
