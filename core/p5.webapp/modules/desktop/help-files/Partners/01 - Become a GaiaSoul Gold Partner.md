Partners are allowed to resell the system, according to a 50/30/20 key profit sharing key. This implies that
you are allowed to sell the system 20% less expensive, and in the process keep 30% of the revenue for yourself.
You apply for becoming a partner by sending an email to thomas@gaiasoul.com - At which point if you are accepted,
you will be sent instructions on an email, showing you how to practically implement reselling the system.
Basically, this implies creating your own distribution (zip file) of the system, with a couple of pre-configured
settings applied, and possibly your own skin and/or branding. This will make your distribution seem
_"kind of like your own product"_, and something that you are selling, allowing you to (almost) completely
hide us in the process.

**Notice** - We only allow people and companies who have _already purchased a valid license for the 8.x version
to become partners_. So the first thing you will have to do, is to purchase at least one license, which you can
do by clicking the _"Home"_ button in this documentation file. This is to avoid people applying for a partner
membership, to simply reduce their own personal licensing costs. We only want partners who are actually dedicated
to reselling the system becoming our partners. However, this mght imply simply selling licenses to your customers,
if you are a developer, making a cut in the process.

### Profit sharing

Your customers again, will still have to purchase using the PayPal button at the index page of the documentation.
But when they do, they will get a 20% discount on their license price. This payment will be associated with
you automatically, and when we have received a valid payment, and 30 days have passed - To make sure the purchase
is not invalidated later by the customer - You will be given 30% of the total price.

**Notice** - You will need your own PayPal account since we need to transfer you your share over PayPal.

### Free Marketing

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner will be listed in our marketing material, and we will help you acquire customers, by
helping you both in your own marketing efforts - In addition to talking nicely about you, and send customers
to you, which is what we actually want - Instead of having to deal with end users (too much) ourselves.
If you create apps and modules on top of Phosphorus Five, and you are a partner, we will also list these
modules in the _"community section"_ of our main distribution, hopefully resulting in more customers coming
your way. **Notice**, this require that you are able to sustain at least some sort of minimum activity level,
both on feedback into the project, and number of licenses sold.

### Completely rebrand the system

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner will be taught in details how to in its entirety rebrand the system, and create a
completely unique distribution, making the system appear such that it's almost an _"inhouse product"_. We
will also teach you how to create your own customizations, such as plugins, distribute Hypereval snippets,
camphora apps, etc, etc, etc. Basically, it allows you to completely create your own unique system, according
to your customers' needs, and distribute this version of the system to your clients.

### Priority support

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner also have priority support, and can request Skype conversations with the architect of
the system, and send emails directly to the main architect - And even request a phone conversation if there's
an absolute emergency. We also to some extent will help out with development of your own products, and can
offer you code reviews, etc - Depending upon your volume and needs.

### Additional tutoring material

As a GaiaSoul Gold Partner, you also gain access to additional training material, particularly on how to create
your own distribution. These might be in the form of documents, and/or videos, which explains to you in details,
exactly how you can go about branding the system, and customizing it - _Without_ becoming incompatible with future
releases of Phosphorus Five. Arguably, this teaches you how to _"fork"_ the system, while still maintaining
compatiblility towards future releases.

### Partner obligations

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner is expected to do all _"first level support"_, which is support about basic usage
of the system, its modules, and its configuration etc. However, there should be a lot of material, both in
these help files, and in our partner package to get you started with this. We only accept support/bug
reports/feature requests directly from our partners, and none of your customers can send us direct support
requests, unless they purchased directly from us - At which point they're not your customer, but ours.
However, this allows you to keep your customers as _yours_, and almost completely _"hide"_ us in the process.

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner is also expected to proactively market his distribution, and setting up a website,
or at least a sub section on an existing website mentioning the product, is expected - And/or actively
communicate the system in the blogosphere and on social media. For partners that are particularly good at
fulfilling their obligations, a special section in the core distribution will be rewarded, mentioning
your products, with links to your website.

### How to apply

To apply for becoming a GaiaSoul Gold Partner, please send an email to thomas@gaiasoul.com - And make sure
you include your PayPal transaction reference ID, such that we can verify that you have purchased at least
one proprietary license of Phosphorus Five.
