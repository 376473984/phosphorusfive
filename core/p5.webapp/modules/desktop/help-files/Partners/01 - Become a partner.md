Partners are allowed to resell the system, according to a 50/30/20 key profit sharing key. This implies that
you are allowed to sell the system 20% less expensive, and in the process keep 30% of the revenue for yourself.
You apply for becoming a partner to thomas@gaiasoul.com - At which point if you are accepted, you will be sent
instructions on an email, showing you how to practically implement reselling the system. Basically, this implies
creating your own distribution (zip file) of the system, with a couple of pre-configured settings applied, and
possibly your own skin and/or branding. This will make your distribution seem _"kind of like your own product"_,
and something that you are selling, allowing you to (almost) completely hide us in the process.

**Notice** - We only allow people and companies who have _already purchased a valid license for the 8.x version
to become partners_. So the first thing you will have to do, is to purchase at least one license, which you can
do by clicking the _"Home"_ button in this documentation file. This is to avoid people applying for a partner
membership, to simply reduce their own personal licensing costs. We only want people and companies who are
actually dedicated to reselling the system becoming our partners.

### Profit sharing

Your customers again, will still have to purchase using the PayPal button at the index page of the documentation.
But when they do, they will get a 20% discount on their license price. This payment will be associated with
you automatically, and when we have received a valid payment, and 30 days have passed - To make sure the purchase
is not invalidated later by the customer - You will be given 30% of the total price.

**Notice** - You will need your own PayPal account since we need to transfer you your share over PayPal.

### Partner obligations

The above requires you to do all _"first level support"_, which is support about basic usage of the system,
and configuration and so on. However, there should be a lot of material, both in these help files, and in
our partner package to get you started with this.

We only accept support/bug reports/feature requests directly from our partners, and none of your customers
can send us support requests, unless they purchased directly from us - At which point they're not your customer,
but ours.

### Free Marketing

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner will be listed in our marketing matieral, and we will help you acquire customers, by
helping you both in your own marketing efforts - In addition to talking nicely about you, and send customers
to you, which is what we actually want - Instead of having to deal with end users (too much) ourselves.
If you create apps and modules on top of Phosphorus Five, and you are a partner, we will also list these
modules in the _"community section"_ of our main distribution, hopefully resulting in more customers coming
your way.

To apply for becoming a GaiaSoul Gold Partner, please send an email to thomas@gaiasoul.com - And make sure
you include your PayPal transaction reference ID, such that we can verify that you have purchased at least
one proprietary license of Phosphorus Five.
