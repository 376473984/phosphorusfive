Partners are allowed to resell the system, according to a 50/50 profit sharing key. This implies that
a partner gets to keep 50% of the revenue from each license he or she sells to his customers.
You apply for becoming a partner by sending an email to thomas@gaiasoul.com - At which point if you are accepted,
you will be sent instructions on an email, showing you how to practically implement reselling the system.
Basically, this implies creating your own distribution (zip file) of the system, with a couple of pre-configured
settings applied, and possibly your own skin and/or branding. This will make your distribution seem
_"kind of like your own product"_, and something that you are selling, allowing you to (almost) completely
hide us in the process.

**Notice** - We only allow people and companies who have _already purchased at least one valid license for the
8.x version to become partners_. So the first thing you will have to do, is to purchase at least one license,
which you can do by clicking the _"home"_ button in this documentation file.

### How can you sell Free Software?

The above question has as many answers as there are distributors - However, why does money hold value?
Money is basically just coloured paper, right? The reasons why money holds value, is because you
can do things with it, that you cannot do with coloured paper. The same is true for a proprietary
license of Phosphorus Five. I have spent more than a decade researching the ideas that are implemented
in Phosphorus Five. This implies tens of thousands of hours, making _your_ job easier. Is your work
worth money? If your answer is no to the previous question, please let me hire you, such that you can
work for me for free! ;)

As a GaiaSoul Gold Partner you get exclusive access to additional modules and material, nobody else gets
access to. This allows you to provide a lot of additional value, on top of the Free Software core, which
makes your offer shine, and makes it easy for you to explain why people should pay you for a zip file.
This comes in addition to any additional services you deliver yourself to sugar coat the pill, such
as support, hosting, services, modules you build, etc. Also remember that you're not legally allowed to
create anything but Open Source software without a proprietary license, and that evverybody with a
proprietary license, can consume the free software modules created by others in their proprietary distributions.

> Free as in Freedom, _not_ as in Free Beer!

### Who can apply?

Actually, anyone, as long as you have bought a valid license for the 8.x release, and you have bought it directly
from us. And in fact, realistically, due to the nature of Phosphorus Five, you don't need to be a multi million
dollar shop to become a partner. If you've got your own company, with only you being an employee, but you have
multiple customers that you are creating software for, and you want to use Phosphorus Five to create your
solutions - You can become a partner, and make a cut in the process, in addition to getting a lot of other
benefits too. In fact, even if you have only _one_ customer, but this single customer needs to install
Phosphorus Five on multiple servers, you can still make money by becoming a partner. This allows you to
get a return on your initial investment of a single machine license after having only sold 2 additional
machine licenses of Phosphorus Five to your customer(s) - And in fact, from that
point and onwards, make 50% profit from every single machine license you sell.

In fact, if you simply have your own blog, and you're interested in learning Phosphorus Five, and earn money
selling a beautiful web operating system - You have everything you need to become a partner, and make a 50% cut
of every license you sell. Arguably, we encourage you to _"fork"_ the system, and sell licenses of it, making
50% profit from each license you sell.

### Profit sharing

Your customers, will still have to purchase using the PayPal button at the index page of the documentation -
Unless you are setting up the entire system for your customer, and have given him a total quote of installation,
setup, etc - At which point you can use a personal PayPal link which we will provide you with, allowing you
to purchase licenses _directly yourself_, on behalf of your customer(s), for a net 50% of the normal price.

If your customers purchase your distribution, you will get 50% profit from each license they purchase. This
payment will be associated with you automatically, and when we have received a valid payment, and 30 days
have passed - To make sure the purchase is not invalidated later by the customer - You will be given 50% of
the total price, minus PayPal fees. And since Phosphorus Five after all is a web application development
framework, and it's being sold on a per machine basis - This implies that every time you install a new
Phosphorus Five server for one of your customers, you get 50% of the profit. Which of course comes in
addition to whatever price you choose to charge for your modules, apps or services.

**Notice** - You will need your own PayPal account, since we either need to transfer you your share over PayPal,
or you'll need to purchase on behalf of your customer(s) using PayPal.

### Free Marketing

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner will be listed in our marketing material, and we will help you acquire customers, by
helping you both in your own marketing efforts - In addition to talking nicely about you, and send customers
to you. If you create apps and modules on top of Phosphorus Five, and you are a partner, we will also list these
modules in the _"community section"_ of our main distribution, hopefully resulting in more customers coming
your way. **Notice**, this require that you are able to sustain at least some sort of minimum activity level,
both on feedback into the project, and number of licenses sold.

### Completely rebrand the system

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner will be taught in details how to in its entirety rebrand the system, and create a
completely unique distribution, making the system appear such that it's almost an _"inhouse product"_. We
will also teach you how to create your own customizations, such as plugins, distribute Hypereval snippets,
Camphora apps, etc, etc, etc. Basically, it allows you to completely create your own unique system, according
to your customers' needs, and distribute this version of the system to your clients.

### Priority support

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner also have priority support, and can request Skype conversations with the architect of
the system, and send emails directly to the main architect - And even request a phone conversation if there's
an absolute emergency. We also to some extent will help out with development of your own products, and can
offer you code reviews, help with your own code, etc.

**Notice**, this require you to have at least some minimum volume on the amount of licenses you sell, or at
least a well argued intention to sell some minimum volume of licenses.

### Additional tutoring material

As a GaiaSoul Gold Partner, you also gain access to additional training material, particularly on how to create
your own distribution. These might be in the form of documents, and/or videos, which explains to you in details,
exactly how you can go about branding the system, and customizing it - _Without_ becoming incompatible with future
releases of Phosphorus Five. Arguably, this teaches you how to _"fork"_ the system, and adding your own little
_"secret sauce"_ in your own distribution - While still maintaining compatiblility with future releases.

### Bonus material

We will also periodically release bonus material, which we only give access to for our partners. This might include
Magic Menu commands, Hypereval snippets, Hyper IDE plugins, or entire applications and modules - Allowing you
to create a _"bonus distribution"_, being much more than the _"core download"_ of Phosphorus Five's Open Source
and Free Software distribution. We will also supply you with additional tutoring material, such as how to
further tighten the security of your distribution, setup the system on multiple heterogenous servers, etc, etc,
etc.

We will also give you access to additional material explaining how to create your own documentation files, to
replace (parts) of the documentation, and create documentation for your own modules and apps - In addition to
how to allow your customers to purchase additional modules from you, from within Phosphorus Five, etc. The last
point would arguably give you your own personal _"app store"_, with automatic PayPal integration, leading to your
PayPal account, where you can charge whatever you wish for your own modules, and keep the entire profit from
the selling of these modules yourself.

Whatever you charge yourself for your own modules, and/or bonus material we give you access to, is _your business_,
as long as you make sure your customers obeys by our license terms, and have valid licenses for Phosphorus Five
from us.

### Our guarantee

We give you this right, irrevocably for the current major release of Phosphorus Five. Which means that we don't
change these terms during the 8.x release cycle of the system. We (might) reconsider the partner program though,
and/or its terms, each major release.

### Partner obligations

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner is expected to do all _"first level support"_ for his customers, which is support about
basic usage of the system, its modules, and its configuration. However, there should be a
lot of material, both in these help files, and in our partner package, to get you started with this. We
do not accept support requests originating from your customers. However, this allows you to keep your
customers as _yours_, and almost completely _"hide"_ us in the process, building your own network of clients.

A GaiaSoul Gold Partner is also expected to proactively market his distribution, and if possible setup a website
marketing his distribution - Or at least mention his distribution on a sub section on an existing website -
And/or actively communicate the system in the blogosphere and on social media. For partners that are particularly good at
fulfilling their obligations, a special section in the core distribution will be rewarded, mentioning
your products and distribution, with links to your website.

**Notice**, we also expect you to follow up on your customers, and make sure your customers obeys by the
license rules of Phosphorus Five - Proactively!

### How to apply

To apply for becoming a GaiaSoul Gold Partner, please send an email to thomas@gaiasoul.com - And make sure
you include your PayPal transaction reference ID, such that we can verify that you have purchased at least
one proprietary license of Phosphorus Five. Please also explain with one or two paragraphs how you intend to
market, brand and resell your distribution - With links to your website(s), if relevant.

**Notice**, we only accept applicants who have bought their license directly from us, for obvious reasons.
