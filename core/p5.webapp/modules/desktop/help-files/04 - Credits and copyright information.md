All other Phosphorus Five modules, are the sole copyright of 
Thomas Hansen - And unless explicitly granted through an individually named _"proprietary enabling license"_,
all Phosphorus Five components and modules are distributed under the terms of the GPL license version 3,
as published by the Free Software Foundation. See the [Free Software Foundation website](https://www.fsf.org/) for details.

**Notice** - The GPL license implies that unless you want to create Open Source software yourself, you'll need
to purchase a proprietary license from me. I too require food to function!

See the above respective Open Source projects for licensing information, but in general they are all _"permissive"_ in nature,
except iTextSharp, which is distributed under an Affero GPL license. Which implies that if you use the PDF
featured of Posphorus Five, you'll have to explicitly link to the parts of your source code in your application
that is using iTextSharp, or purchase a proprietary enabling license from the publishers of iTextSharp. If 
this is a problem, then simply **avoid using the PDF features in Phosphorus Five**, and you should be safe.

In addition, I would like to say a special thank you to the following people and organisations.

* My three diamonds, you know who you are
* Jeffrey Steadfast for giving me excellent support and help when ever I got stuck in MimeKit or MailKit
* Svein Daniel Solvenus for providing feedback in the early stages of the project
* Michael Desmond and James McCaffrey for allowing me to write three articles at MSDN Magazine
* The Mono project for making my work possible
* All my friends for being amazing and helping me at a point in my life when I was not _"OK"_
* And last but not least, my beautiful and amazing _"wife"_ and partner, Lisbeth Aardal, for supporting me in a time of my life, when the word utter despair, was a much too soft of a description, for describing my status

### None mentioned, none forgotten

There are extremely strong forces in this universe who do not want to see me succeed with my vision - Which
is to democratize the art of creating web apps, to distribute the World Wide Web, and the powers it holds for
humanity. I invented Managed Ajax in 2006, I wrote a business plan called _"Gaia, Web OS"_ in 2007,
I invented Active Events in 2009, and I created the first implementation of Hyperlambda in 2013 - With the sole
intent of distributing power, and democratize the internet. I have literally spent more than a decade
chasing this idea!

In this process, I have had my name slandered, I have gone to jail on two different continents, I have
been physically deported from Silicon Valley, I have in periods lived as a homeless on the street, and I
have literally been crucified - Because I believe in a democratized world wide web, and commoditizing
the art of creating software. I have fled from country to country, living as a refugee - And my last
experience in Norway, before I fled to Cyprus, where I am living today in exile - Was a failed
assassination attempt at my person and my wife.

If you believe as I do, that Phosphorus Five has value for you, and the world at large - I would seriously
consider purchasing a _"commercial license"_ for the system - Or at the very least support me financially
any ways you can. This system, believe it or not, was in its entirety created by one single human being -
Me that is - And I am _not_ a rich man. In fact, quite the contrary! You can donate money to me below.
