<p>System42 is an example minimalistic content management system, built on top of <a href="http://github.com/polterguy/phosphorus-five">Phosphorus Five</a>. Its purpose is to be an example CMS, while at the same time giving you some useful tools to get started with Phosphorus Five.</p>

<p>Through p5.lambda and Hyperlisp, you can orchestrate your web application <strong>together</strong>, using a high-level abstraction language, that doesn&#39;t require much, if any, pre-existing programming skills from you. This creates opportunities for non-developers to create complex web applications, while at the same time retaining the possibility to dive into <em>real</em> programming for system developers.</p>

<p>This way your developers can focus on what they should focus on, allowing non-technical staff to orchestrate together what your developers create.</p>

<h3>Username/password</h3>

<p>When you start system42 for the first time, then a default user with the username/password combination of <em>admin/admin</em> is created for you. Login in the navigational menu at the top.</p>
