The main desktop for the "micro web operating system"
========

This folder contains all the files relevant to the desktop of your tiny "micro web operating system". It basically creates
a launcher desktop environment for your root URL, and allows your users to launch which ever apps they have installed
in their _"/modules/"_ folder.

If you do not want to use this feature of Phosphorus Five, you can simply delete the entire folder, at which point you're
gonne have to create your own **[p5.web.load-ui]** URL resolver yourself.
