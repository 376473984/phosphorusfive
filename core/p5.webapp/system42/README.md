system42
========

system42 is a CMS and Web Application Framework built on top of phosphorus.five.  to
use system42, you will need to download http://github.com/polterguy/phosphorus-five
and put the system42 folder inside of your "phosphorus.application-pool" folder, and
modify the web.config in the same folder, such that your *"application-startup-file"*
becomes *"system42/application-startup.hl"* instead of its default setting

in addition you will also need to have mono, Xamarin or MonoDevelop installed, since
phosphorus.five is built on top of ASP.NET on Mono and C#

the purpose of system42 is to provide a web application platform and environment that
allows you to create your own web apps and websites, by orchestrating together existing
building blocks.  at one level, system42 is a website CMS, or a Content Management
System, that allows you to create your own websites, the same way other CMS systems
allows you to.  at another level, system42 is an application development platform, 
allowing you to easily create your own web apps, to administrate your business needs,
or personal needs for administration systems and data gathering

by combining system42 with your own web server, and some development or configuration,
you can take back control over your own data, and your online life, instead of having
to rely on gigantic spyware websites such as google, youtube, facebook, and so on.
the long term goal of system42, is to in its entirety commoditize, everything you today 
must use some silicon valley service for achieving.  this will in the long run free you
from your government's ability to spy on you, and give you back the control of your
everyday life

system42 is far from its long term goal yet, but by intelligent usage of new paradigms
in system development, and new ways of thinking about programming and web apps, its
destiny is to rapidly eat market shares from all the previously mentioned websites,
allowing you to become your own *"marc zuckerberg"*

system42 is also a reference implementation for phosphorus.five, proving that a CMS
can be built entirely on top of p5.lambda and Hyperlisp, without having to code any
custom C# to meet the requirements for a CMS. therefor system42 becomes the proof of
that you can create complex enterprise web applications on top of phosphorus.five, 
simply by orchestrating your apps together as loosely coupled Active Events through
p5.lambda, making the development of enterprise applications significantly easier,
more fun and flexible than what you're used to from other competing systems, such as 
SharePoint, DotNetNuke, etc

## what does the name mean?

the name *"system42"* is a reference to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and
signifies what's known in that book as the *"Meaning of the Universe, Life and 
Everything"*
