System42
========

System42 is an example minimalistic Web Operating System, built on top of 
Phosphorus Five. If you wish to use Phosphorus Five as a stand alone framework, you
should delete the entire System42 folder, and modify the "application-startup-file"
setting in your web.config underneath p5.webapp. This allows you to create web
apps from scratch, having complete control over every aspect of your systems.

The purpose of System42 is to provide a starting point and example implementation 
when developing p5 apps, in addition to being a useful Web Operating System by itself.

System42 contains a minimalistic Web Operating System, allowing you to transparently
use your web server as an extension of your other devices, sharing, storing and
having backup of your files, in addition to all other things you'd normally use
cloud services for. In such a way, System42 becomes an extension of your Intranet,
allowing you access to your private files and data, on evey device you own, such
as your iPhone, Android, Tablets, PCs, Mac OSX computers, etc, etc, etc.

System42 can also be used as an IDE for developing apps in Hyperlisp and p5 Lambda.

System42 can also be used as a Content Management System (CMS or Publishing System)
for sharing information, creating websites, webapps, etc, etc, etc. In plain English;
System42 is a Web Operating System.
