System42
========

System42 is an example minimalistic CMS and Web Application Framework built on top of 
phosphorus.five. If you wish to use Phosphorus Five as a stand alone framework, you
should delete the entire System42 folder, and modify the "application-startup-file"
setting in your web.config for p5.webapp

The purpose of system42 is to provide a starting point and example implementation 
when developing p5 apps.

System42 contains a minimalistic CMS system, featuring creation of plain HTML files,
in addition to more rich web apps, built using p5.lambda and control definition files.
