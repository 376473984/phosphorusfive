System42's starup scripts
========

This folder contains all of your System42 startup scripts, which are Hyperlambda scripts, evaluated when the server starts.
Often these files will create some helper Active Events, and do other types of initialization necessary for your system to work.

Notice, if you build your own "component" or "app", you should rather put your startup script into your component/application
specific startup folder, and not into this folder, which are for "globally" necessary startup scripts.
