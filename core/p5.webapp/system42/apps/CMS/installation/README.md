Installation scripts
========

This folder contains the Hyperlambda scripts, necessary to install your server, the first time. Typically, it will
allow you to create a unique random server-salt, which is used to hash passwords and such for users. In addition, 
it will allow you to create a "root account passsword".

These scripts will only be evaluated once, during the first startup of your server.
