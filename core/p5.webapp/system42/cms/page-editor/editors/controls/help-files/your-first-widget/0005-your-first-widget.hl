This is what makes Phosphorus Five a <em>""Rich Web User Interface Application Framework""</em>, because it allows you to build
almost any types of traditional applications you wish to build. (not speaking about graphic intensive apps, such as games and 3D rendering
that is though)"

in your WYSIWYG design surface, such that it is yellow. Then go to the bottom of your page, and click the <em>""innerValue""</em>
