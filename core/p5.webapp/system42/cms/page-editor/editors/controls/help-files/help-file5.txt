to your widgets. This wizard will suggest element names for you, or attribute names for you, such that you do not accidentally
add up an <em>"illegal element name or attribute"</em>.</p>

<p>This wizard can be found by clicking the question mark (?) next to the <strong>[element] or [+Add attribute]</strong> buttons.</p>

<p>This will give you a complete list of all legal attributes or element names for your widgets. With a button shortcut to add the attribute,
or use the specific element name.</p>

<p>These lists are constrained by the definition of HTML5, as published by W3C. You can find more information about HTML5 at
<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla's website</a>. Notice that not all elements
are legal to add inside another element, and not all attributes can be used on all elements. For instance, the &lt;video&gt; element,
has a <em>"src"</em> attribute, for its video URL. This attribute is not legal to add to for instance a <em>"div"</em> element.</p>

<p>By creating the correct element, with the correct attributes, you can combine your widget hierarchy, to represent any legal HTML5
you wish. With Phosphorus Five, you have 100% control over the rendered HTML result. While at the same time, keeping a seemless integration
towards your server-side Hyperlisp/C# code.</p>
