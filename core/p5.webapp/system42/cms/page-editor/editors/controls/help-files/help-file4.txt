<em>"children widgets"</em> part of your designer. By clicking these buttons, you can select that specific widget as 
a <em>"shortcut"</em>.</p>

<p>If you have selected a widget, which is a child of another widget (and not a "root" widget on your page), then you
can select its parent widget by clicking the up arrow button button.</p>

<p>This allows you to easily navigate back and forth, between children widgets and its parent widget, without having
to attempting to clicking at the exact correct place on your surface, or finding it in the select dropdown list.</p>

<p>You can nest as many [container] widgets inside of each other as you wish, to create any number of nested levels of [container] widgets.
You can also type in any arbitrary HTML as the values of <em>"innerValue"</em> of your [literal] widgets.</p>
