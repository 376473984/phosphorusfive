Contains CSV file helper Active Events
===============

This directory contains Hyperlambda that creates a CSV file import Active event called [sys42.csv.import], which simply
imports a CSV file, and puts it into the [p5.data](/plugins/p5.data/) database. Pass in [_arg] as file to import.

Example usage.

```
sys42.csv.import:~/documents/private/sample.csv
```
