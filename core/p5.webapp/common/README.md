Common files
========

This folder contains files and documents which does not belong to a specific user,
but rather the server itself, or all users as a whole. Any file within the "public" folder
can easily be accessed with anyone with a direct link. The files within the "private"
folder can only be accessed using for instance the *[echo-file]* Active Event.

This is the place you should put files that are supposed to be shared among
multiple users of your system.
