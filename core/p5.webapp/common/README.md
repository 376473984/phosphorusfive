Common files
========

This folder contains files and documents which does not belong to a specific user, but rather the server itself, or all users as a whole. 
Any file within the _"/documents/public"_ folder can easily be accessed with anyone with a direct link. The files within the _"/documents/private/"_
folder, can only be accessed using for instance the *[p5.web.echo-file]* Active Event.

This is the place you should put files that are supposed to be shared among multiple users of your system.
