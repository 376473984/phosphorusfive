       those instances, and have them registered yourself for each ApplicationContext object in your application.

        The next setting, defines how many ViewState values will be stored in session for each session object.
        If your users are notified often that there was too many viewstate values for the current session, and 
        that their current ViewState key was invalidated, you might consider increasing this value. If you 
        increase it though, the amount of memory used for each session object in your application, will increase, 
        and hence the memory usage of your application, will increase. A good number os probably between 5 and 10.
        If you set it to 0, then no ViewState will be stored in the session. This is a major security risk, due to
        the internals of Phosphorus Five, and how it stores p5.lambda objects for Web Widgets in the ViewState.
        If you set it to -1, then the number of ViewState objects per session becomes infinite, which is also a major
        security risk, since then any session can easily use up all memory of your server, simply by pressing F5 many times.

        This Active Event is raised by Phosphorus Five during the beginning of a HTTP request, and is expected to load
        the User Interface, or do other things, dependent upon which type of web-server you're setting up.
