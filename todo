* gzip javascript files through pre-build step on Release-Linux

* create support for "array" p5.lambda type, which allows to be used as an expression for Expression.Iterate, such that
  users may submit a static array of values to stuff such as "for-each", "set-session-value-value", etc

* store timezone (GTM+x) in DateTime when serializing and de-serializing from Hyperlisp

* create support for "style" property setters/getters in widgets through p5.lambda optionally can take a list of style names/values, instead
  of like it is now where it's "just a string"

* Exception hierarchy

* reference nodes in Hyperlisp, where value is an expression, leading to a node, such that values of nodes, can reference
  another node in Hyperlisp as an expression, allowing for "late binding" after Nodes are created, maybe ...?

* finish up comments and documentation

* clean up comments on all Active Events and the rest of the library

* finish up MongoDB plugin ...

* Comet (LazyHttp) support

* [zip] and [unzip] Active Events

* more [crypto] features, using BouncyCastle

* Email send receive support through MimeKit

* [rel-source] on [set-session-value-value] and friends

* make sure [sys42.show-tree] can "append more results" to itself, such that it keeps the same dialogue for multiple invocations
  during the same, and consecutive request

* plugin architecture for creating custom iterators, both using C# and in p5.lambda

* "-1" property for ViewStateInSession property, to allow "infinite" number of ViewState keys in Session object, with a BIG warning
  to user that this posess a security risk though!

* "sockets" Active Events library, for creating Daemons to listen to ports, and react accordingly

* create support for trapping and throwing exceptions in p5.lambda

* make it possible to create "User Controls Widgets", which are widgets that exists in files, 
  and makes it possible to pass in parameters

* make it possible to get/set/remove/list etc, also JavaScript events, and not only Active Events, like it is now

* sys42 - "New wizard page ..." feature, for creating a p5.page through a wizard.

* cryptography support for encrypting and decrypting "anything"

* verify all Active Events handles arguments the same way (session, cookies, etc)

* make sure widget events works the same way as dynamically created global events in regards to arguments passed in and so on

* make it possible to load javascript files, and execute javascript code, before and after the other, such that
  code added, and files added, will be evaluated on client in that order. CKEditor requires this in a weird way for instance ...
