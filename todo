* support for sending objects as parameters over http requests by appending objects in 'onbefore' in pf.element.raise options

* compress javascript files through pre-build step on Linux-Build

* create unit tests

* create support for saving class.id in control state for dynamically added widgets, such that dynamically added widgets will
  be re-created during postbacks

* create cache of MethodInfo to use in InvokeEventHandler to optimize use of reflection, and investigate if we can get completely rid
