### Who create Phosphorus Five?

Every single line of code was created by me (Thomas Hansen), except where I use
libraries, and/or other external free software resources, which I explicitly
mark as such.

### Who owns the copyright for Phosphorus Five?

It is in its entirety owned by Thomas Hansen, in person, which is a conscious choice,
since it gives me a higher amount of security and freedom.

### Can I invest in Phosphorus Five?

__NO!__ Go away, I don't want to talk to you, and I don't intend to explain why either.
Go buy BitCoin or something ...

### Can I ask you to hold a course for me and my developers?

Sure, I do this all the time, depending upon my schedule. Shoot me an email at
thomas@gaiasoul.com, and I'll check my schedule, and try to squeeze you in.
It'll cost you though, and I expect you to pay all my expenses, in addition
to my fee. For reasons I don't intend to explain here though, I don't travel
to the USA, and I highly unlikely ever will either. If you live in the USA, and
you want me to hold a course for you and your developers, could I suggest getting
a passport? And maybe go see some more of this beautiful world we live in? The French
Riviera, Italy and Greece are among some of my favourites. But the world is
spectacularly beautiful, especially _outside_ of the USA. And yes, I have lived
3 years in the California, so I know what I'm talking about - 3 years was enough for
me (say no more) ... ;)

Believe it or not, but the world (outside of the USA) is actually _not_ filled
with terrorists, and, quote _"people who hate your freedoms"_.

### Were you that guy I saw on a white Harley in LA, with a Cuban cigar, and a small black dog in your saddle bag?

Probably yes ...

### Did we once meet in San Francisco, Barcelona, Copenhagen, "pick your city"?

Probably yes, people tend to remember meeting me. I consider myself an _"opinionated nomadic software developer"_,
and I travel a lot, and often I stay at the same place for several years, before I move on,
to see more of this beautiful Earth of ours.

### Are you the guy playing Saxophone, Harmonica, Guitar on your videos?

Yup!

### What are your personal political preferences?

Anarchy! I don't like Trump, I don't like Hilary, and I certainly do not like
Obama either - In fact, when I think more thoroughly about this, I don't think I have ever
met a politician whom I like, and whom I would enjoy having a conversation with - And
I have certainly never met one whom I would trust with the decision making processes in my
life. If you have a problem with that, may I suggest _"voting harder"_
the next time ...?

I am a purebred __Anarchist__, to the bone! And you couldn't get me to vote,
even if my life depended upon it!

> Kim Jong Il, Stalin, Hitler, Obama, Trump - They're all the same to me ...

### How can I become your best friend?

Fork Mono, rip out everything not related to ASP.NET WebForms, stay compatible to
the CLR (to allow for using 3rd party libraries), and make a script that installs
your stuff on Apache, that's dead simple to build - And I'll (almost) tattoo your
name on my chest, above my heart, with a _"friends forever"_ above your head!

### How on Earth did you do this? (Create Phosphorus Five)

I spent 13 years researching the same idea, and I followed Winston Churchill's advice,
which goes like this ...

> Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever give up!

Then mix a little bit of brilliance, and a little bit of madness to the pot - And __VOILA!__
Phosphorus Five comes out in the other end ...

### Who controls the development of Phosphorus Five?

I am the Gaia Lactical Overlord, and Ajax Uhuru Uber Guru, Il Duce, Der Fuhrer
and Kim Jong Il the 3rd when it comes to the final decisions in regards to the future development
of Phosphorus Five. 100% dictator, and overlord of Phosphorus Five. Basically, I created
my own little universe here, and I intend to stay _"god"_ within it - Don't like the idea?
Go create your own universe.

I do however take suggestions from others, and I do consider myself quite polite - Contrary to many others
in my position ... (You know who I'm talking about here I assume, without me having to mention names ... ;) )

### What's your sense of humor?

I consider [Dr. Strangelove to be the Mona Lisa of Humor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9ihKq34Ozc).
