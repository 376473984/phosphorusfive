### How do I submit a patch?

You don't. For legal reasons I cannot accept patches to Phosphorus Five. You can
fork it, submit a bug report, tap into its plugin architecture, and probably
change any aspect of it without rendering your code incompatible - But I cannot
accept patches to it. Sorry. If you can accurately describe your problem though,
preferably with a simple to use reproducible, I would love to help you out.
I also deeply appreciate suggestions.

### Who create Phosphorus Five?

Every single line of code was created by me (Thomas Hansen), except where I use
libraries, and/or other external free software resources, which I explicitly
mark as such.

### Who owns the copyright for Phosphorus Five?

It is in its entirety owned by Thomas Hansen, in person, me that is, which is a
conscious choice, since it gives me a higher amount of security and freedom.

### Can I invest in Phosphorus Five?

__NO!__ Go away, I don't want to talk to you, and I don't intend to explain why either.
Go buy BitCoin or something ...

### Can I ask you to hold a course for me and my developers?

Sure, I do this all the time, depending upon my schedule. Shoot me an email at
thomas@gaiasoul.com, and I'll check my schedule, and try to squeeze you in.
It'll cost you though, and I expect you to pay all my expenses, in addition
to my fee. For reasons I don't intend to explain here though, I don't travel
to the USA, and I highly unlikely ever will either. If you live in the USA, and
you want me to hold a course for you and your developers, could I suggest getting
a passport? And maybe go see some more of this beautiful world we live in? The French
Riviera, Italy and Greece are among some of my favourites. But the world is
spectacularly beautiful, especially _outside_ of the USA. And yes, I have lived
3 years in the California, so I know what I'm talking about - 3 years was enough for
me (say no more) ... ;)

Believe it or not, but the world (outside of the USA) is actually _not_ filled
with terrorists, and, quote _"people who hate your freedoms"_.

### Were you that guy I saw on a white Harley in LA, with a Cuban cigar, and a small black dog in your saddle bag?

Probably yes ...

### Are you the guy playing Saxophone, Harmonica, Guitar, Singing on your videos?

Yup! My main hobbies, besides traveling, includes creation of music, and I almost plays equally
many instruments, as I know programming languages. Sometimes you'll see me playing on
the streets, of some weird city, where few of you have ever been. I once hitchhiked
through California, making a living as a street musician, sleeping outside. What
can I say, I probably have som _"Gypsy blood"_ in me ... ;)

### What are your personal political preferences?

__Anarchy__! I don't like Trump, I don't like Hilary, and I don't like
Obama - In fact, when I think more thoroughly about this, I don't think I have ever
met a politician whom I like, and whom I would enjoy having a conversation with - And
I have certainly never met one whom I would trust with the decision making processes in my
life.

I am a purebred __Anarchist__, to the bone! And you couldn't get me to vote,
even if my life depended upon it! I support _"nobody for President!"_

### What is your formal education

9 years of elementary school. I am autodidact, and I am proud about it. I consider
public schools to be the primary engine in societies brainwashing machine. Still
I know more programming languages, and often times more math too, than most
PhDs I have met in my life.

### How on Earth did you do this? (Create Phosphorus Five)

I spent 13 years researching the same idea, and I followed Winston Churchill's advice,
which goes like this ...

> Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever give up!

Then mix a little bit of brilliance, and a little bit of madness - And __VOILA!__
Phosphorus Five comes out in the other end ...

### Who controls the development of Phosphorus Five?

I am the Gaia Lactical Overlord, and Ajax Uber Uhuru Guru, Il Duce, Der Fuhrer,
and Kim Jong Il the 3rd when it comes to the final decisions in regards to the future development
of Phosphorus Five. 100% dictator, the resurrected Kublai Khan, sole emperor over Phosphorus Five.
I created my own little universe here, and I intend to be _"god"_ within it - Don't like the idea?
[Go create your own universe](https://github.com/new).

I do however take suggestions from others, and I do consider myself quite polite, and I am
famous for changing my mind, once my existing mind no longer compiles. You are also welcome to
play with me, inside of my little Universe, as long as you are nice to others, and
restrain yourself from being rude.

### What's your sense of humor?

I consider [this to be the Mona Lisa of Humor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8NQficzZg).

### What's your email address?

thomas@gaiasoul.com

### Can I sponsor the project?

Sure, if you represent a company, and or some individual with a deep wallet, and
you'd like to be represented as an _"official sponsor"_ to the project - Feel free
to shoot me an email at thomas@gaiasoul.com. I am in the process of setting up
a general sponsor thing, allowing for sponsors to be mentioned in the documentation
for the system, with a small pitch about their produtcs and services, and a link
to their website. Which might (or might not) get you more customers to your products
and services.

### Can I resell Phosphorus Five?

[Yup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFUSenWxrOM)!
